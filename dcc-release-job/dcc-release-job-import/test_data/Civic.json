  "variantSummary" : "JAK2 V617F is a highly recurrent mutation in myeloproliferative diseases. It is found in around 98% of patients with polycythemia vera, and just over half of the patients with essential thrombocythemia and primary myelofibrosis. While less associated with cancer, when it is seen, it is more likely to be in myeloid leukemias than lymphoid leukemias. The V617F mutation is an activating mutation, resulting in increased kinase activity. The mutation seems to be restricted to hematologic malignancies. Treatment of JAK mutant diseases with ruxolitinib has seen some clinical success.",
