DCC is required for netrin-induced axon attraction. DCC is a transmembrane protein lacking any identifiable catalytic activity. Protein tyrosine kinase 2/FAK and src family kinases bind constitutively to the cytoplasmic domain of DCC and their activation couples to downstream intracellular signaling complex that directs the organization of actin.","pathway":{"species":"Homo sapiens","evidence_code":"TAS","diagrammed":false,"hierarchy":[[{"diagrammed":true,"id":"R-HSA-1266738","name":"Developmental Biology"},{"diagrammed":true,"id":"R-HSA-422475","name":"Axon guidance"},{"diagrammed":true,"id":"R-HSA-373752","name":"Netrin-1 signaling"},{"diagrammed":false,"id":"R-HSA-418885","name":"DCC mediated attractive signaling"}]]},"_summary":{"_gene_count":1}}
