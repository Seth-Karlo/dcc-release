Often associated with tumors that are wild-type for other drivers (EGFR and ALK specifically), the prognosis for patients with this mutation seems to be worse than the KRAS wild-type cohort in patients with colorectal and pancreatic cancer, however this hypothesis is in need of further validation. This mutation, along with the mutations affecting the neighboring G13 position, may result in a less responsive tumor when treated with first-generation TKI's like gefitinib. However, cetuximab treatment was shown to extend survival in a cohort of colorectal patients.","variantOrigin":"Somatic Mutation","lastViewDate":"2015-06-21 16:49:39 UTC","evidenceCivicUrl":"https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/8","variantCivicUrl":"https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/76","geneCivicUrl":"https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/30"}
